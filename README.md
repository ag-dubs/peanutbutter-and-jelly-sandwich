> an example repo about contributing to open source

a project's commit history should read like a recipe. this repository
shows the open source process of making a PR, back and forth communication
with the maintainer (bizarro ashley, @ag-dubs) and the contributor
(ashley williams, @ashleygwilliams).

you'll learn how+why to:
- find/"claim" an issue
- make a work-in-progress (WIP) pull-request(PR)
- commit to the PR
- squash your commits

git can be a barrier to contributing to open source. so can all this 
undocumented process. hopefully this helps.

blog post coming soon.
